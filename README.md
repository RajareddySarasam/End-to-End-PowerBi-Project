# End-to-End-PowerBi-Project

Project Title: Sales Insights Dashboard

Description:
Led the development of a Sales Insights Dashboard using Power BI to meet business requirements. Assembled various data sources including sales, categories, geography, products, sales representatives, and subcategories. Implemented mechanisms to load files from the sales folder into a single Sales fact table, ensuring resilience to missing files and automatic loading of new yearly sales data.

Performed data modeling tasks to split the country and city in the "Location" field for geo mapping, and updated date formats for analysis. Created unique keys in the Sales and Geography tables and developed a function to clean ID columns in SalesRep and SubCategory queries for consistency.

Constructed the Data Model connecting all tables and integrated the Calendar table for efficient analysis. Implemented DAX calculations to calculate total revenue, total cost, gross profit, gross profit MoM growth, and average sales per day. Conducted breakdown analysis by product and computed time measures such as QoQ growth for quarterly business review reports.

Utilized the generated measures and calculations to assemble an insightful sales report with diverse visuals on a single-page dashboard. Ensured proper sorting of months from Jan-Dec when plotting monthly data on the x-axis.

Result: Delivered an interactive Sales Insights Dashboard providing actionable insights for informed decision-making and business optimization.
